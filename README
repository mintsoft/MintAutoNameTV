This is a wrapper or two around a PHP class I found somewhere on the internet for the tvdb (thetvdb.com)'s XML API.

Unfortunately, the original location has vanished and so too has the cached copy I found; so many thanks for the code whoever wrote it!

Requirements
=====
Bash, PHP5 (probably works on any version of 5, but tested with 5.3)

Usage
=====
Use the wrapper (to allow wildcards and bash expansion to do its voodoo)
./autoname /my/target/directory/*

./autoname -? will produce usage information

this will output bash script for you to review and execute, the preferred technique is as follows:

	./autoname /my/target/directory/* > ~/targetDir.sh
	cat ~/targetDir.sh | bash

With the user inspecting targetDir.sh before execution
